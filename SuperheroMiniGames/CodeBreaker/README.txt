Code Breaker simulates a hostile encryption console. Heroes race to decode the passphrase before the lock engages and activates the villain's contingency plan.

## Fast Edit Knobs
- **Code Length** *(number, default 5)* – Determines how many characters the hero must unscramble.
- **Attempt Limit** *(number, default 6)* – Sets the number of failed guesses allowed before the console wipes itself.
- **Cipher Set** *(select, default Alphanumeric)* – Chooses the symbol set presented to the player (classic letters, quantum glyphs, or emoji runes).

## Deployment Tips
1. Deploy the puzzle to the hero who is interfacing with the console.
2. Use the attempt tracker to narrate alarms, countermeasures, or team assistance when the limit runs low.
3. Switching cipher sets mid-scene is a great way to escalate difficulty for seasoned operatives.
