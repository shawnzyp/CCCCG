Tech Lockpick now plays like a Fallout-style console hack. You jack into a corp terminal, comb through a clutter of candidate passphrases, and deduce the right word before the watchdog locks you out.

## Fast Edit Knobs
- **Lock Complexity** *(select, default Standard)* – Sets how many passphrases fill the terminal buffer and how long each is.
- **Failures Allowed** *(number, default 2)* – How many wrong passwords the crew can try before ICE slams the console.
- **Support Drones Available** *(toggle, default on)* – When active, a debug script can purge a dud word from the list.

## Deployment Tips
1. Deploy to hackers or augment junkies any time a story beat calls for cracking a corp console or air-gapped vault terminal.
2. Each failed attempt can escalate countermeasures: flickering monitors, angry sysadmins, or ICE routines creeping toward hard lock.
3. If support drones are active, frame the debug script as bracket-matching heuristics or a rogue helper AI carving out extra time.
