Tech Lockpick lets a hero bypass advanced security. They strip shielding, spoof biometrics, and coax alien tech to obey.

## Fast Edit Knobs
- **Lock Complexity** *(select, default Standard)* – Dictates how many distinct subsystems must be solved.
- **Failures Allowed** *(number, default 2)* – The number of strike tokens the hero can accumulate before the lock seals.
- **Support Drones Available** *(toggle, default on)* – When active, provides a single-use AI assist that can auto-clear one subsystem.

## Deployment Tips
1. Deploy to gadgeteers or tech-savvy characters when the team hits a secure vault.
2. Spend failures to introduce sparks, counter-hacks, or collateral damage opportunities.
3. If support drones are active, describe their personality to keep the scene lively.
