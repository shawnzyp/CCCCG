Stratagem Hero is a tactical planning board. The player orchestrates an operation, allocates assets, and reacts to unfolding intel.

## Fast Edit Knobs
- **Mission Profile** *(select, default Rescue)* – Sets the scenario focus: infiltration, rescue, or sabotage.
- **Intel Level** *(select, default Briefed)* – Chooses how much support HQ provides, from blind drops to full overwatch.
- **Team Synergy Boost** *(toggle, default off)* – Grants a one-time teamwork advantage that can shift the odds during critical actions.

## Deployment Tips
1. Use the mission profile to mirror the story beat the heroes are tackling.
2. Adjust the intel level mid-play to represent evolving support or setbacks.
3. Activate the synergy boost when players coordinate a clever plan and reward their collaboration.
