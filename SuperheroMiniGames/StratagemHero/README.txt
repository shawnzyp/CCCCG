Stratagem Hero ports the Helldivers-style stratagem mini-game into the campaign: slam in directional inputs to call down super-team support while the signal holds.

## Fast Edit Knobs
- **Stratagem Drops to Complete** *(number, default 5)* – How many successful call-ins are required to clear the console.
- **Signal Difficulty** *(select, default Training Run)* – Expands the pool of stratagem codes from short routines to brutal doomsday chains.
- **Signal Tolerance (Errors Allowed)** *(number, default 3)* – How many corrupted inputs the uplink can absorb before HQ cuts the transmission.

## Table Use
1. Read the active stratagem name aloud and describe its effect when players succeed.
2. Encourage players to shout directions together to mimic hectic Helldivers call-ins.
3. Drop the signal tolerance or bump the difficulty to reflect escalating mission stakes.
