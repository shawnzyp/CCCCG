Power Surge places the hero at an unstable generator. They must balance output, ride out wave surges, and keep the facility intact.

## Fast Edit Knobs
- **Stability Target (%)** *(number, default 80)* – The operating window the hero must maintain to avert meltdown.
- **Surge Waves** *(number, default 3)* – Number of escalating surges that slam the hero before the grid stabilises.
- **Stability Checks** *(select, default Skill Tests)* – Defines the type of rolls or narrative beats required (skill, power, or mixed challenges).

## Deployment Tips
1. The surge waves make great narrative beats—announce each wave as a new phase of the encounter.
2. Adjust the stability target to reflect how battered the generator already is.
3. Pair different stability check types with specific party members for collaborative scenes.
