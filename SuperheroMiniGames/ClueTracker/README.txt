Clue Tracker tasks a hero with connecting scattered intel before the trail goes cold. The DM supplies a dossier of clues and the player must arrange them in the correct sequence to reveal the target.

## Fast Edit Knobs
- **Clues to Reveal** *(number, default 3)* – Controls how many verified clues are available at the start of play.
- **Time per Clue (seconds)** *(number, default 90)* – Sets the window the player has to respond before the system automatically exposes the next clue.
- **Include Red Herrings** *(toggle, default off)* – Adds misleading hints that must be disproved before they contaminate the evidence chain.

## Deployment Tips
1. Brief the player on the scene and drop the corresponding clue card set.
2. Adjust the fast edit knobs in the DM tools and deploy the mini-game to the target hero.
3. During play, the hero can tag each dossier card as a connected lead or flag it as a red herring to track their deductions.
4. Use the deployment tracker to escalate the situation if the timer runs out or if too many red herrings are accepted.
