Lockdown Override challenges a hero to stabilise a base security system before automated defences escalate. The player must reroute power, silence alarms, and reset locks while the timer counts down.

## Narrative Stakes
- **Why it matters:** The base is moments away from sealing into a hardened killbox. If the override fails, automated turrets and gas floods fire up while allies and civilians are trapped inside.
- **Why the heroes act:** They are buying time for an evacuation team evacuating civilians from the lower decks. Each stabilised subsystem delays the lockdown long enough for people to escape.
- **Failure consequences:** When the timer hits zero without a successful override, security countermeasures engage at full force, cutting the team off from objectives or forcing a costly breakout scene.

## Fast Edit Knobs
- **Security Level** *(select, default Amber)* – Sets the number of subsystems that must be cleared (Green is easiest, Crimson is the full gauntlet).
- **Override Timer (seconds)** *(number, default 300)* – Controls how long the hero has before the lockdown seals permanently.
- **Hazard Suppression Enabled** *(toggle, default on)* – When on, traps pause during the mini-game; when off, narrate stray lasers, gas jets, or drones interfering with the hero.

## Deployment Tips
1. Pair the security level with the current scene stakes—Crimson works well for major set pieces where a disaster is minutes away.
2. Use the hazard toggle to inject dynamic complications if other players want to assist or when the defence grid is actively fighting back.
3. If the timer expires, trigger a narrative twist such as a rival faction breaking through, the base sealing the heroes inside, or civilians suffering casualties that escalate the campaign stakes.
