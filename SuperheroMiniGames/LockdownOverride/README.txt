Lockdown Override challenges a hero to stabilise a base security system before automated defences escalate. The player must reroute power, silence alarms, and reset locks while the timer counts down.

## Fast Edit Knobs
- **Security Level** *(select, default Amber)* – Sets the number of subsystems that must be cleared (Green is easiest, Crimson is the full gauntlet).
- **Override Timer (seconds)** *(number, default 300)* – Controls how long the hero has before the lockdown seals permanently.
- **Hazard Suppression Enabled** *(toggle, default on)* – When on, traps pause during the mini-game; when off, narrate stray lasers, gas jets, or drones interfering with the hero.

## Deployment Tips
1. Pair the security level with the current scene stakes—Crimson works well for major set pieces.
2. Use the hazard toggle to inject dynamic complications if other players want to assist.
3. If the timer expires, trigger a narrative twist such as a rival faction breaking through or the base sealing the heroes inside.
