TRANSCENDENT TRAITS
Level 20 • Ascendant Tier (Ω)
Choose one Transcendent Trait upon reaching Level 20.
You cannot change this choice. It defines your legend.

1. The Living Conduit (Elemental / Energy Masters)
Your body becomes a stable bridge between realities. Energy flows through you like a planetary core.
•	Effect: You gain immunity to one energy type (fire, cold, lightning, radiant, or necrotic).
•	Once per day, you may channel that energy outward in a 60 ft. radius, dealing 10d10 damage of that type (DEX save for half, DC = 8 + your highest ability mod + proficiency).
•	Narrative: The environment around you bends to your resonance lights flicker, metal hums, or water ripples as you walk.

2. The Timeless One (Speedsters, Chronokinetics, Telekinetics)
Time no longer rules you; it merely negotiates.
•	Effect: You gain a permanent extra turn each round, taken at your initiative –10 (you act twice).
•	Once per long rest, you can reverse the last round for all creatures but yourself.
•	Narrative: Clocks near you stop. Your voice sometimes overlaps itself by seconds.

3. The Unbroken Form (Physical Powerhouses)
Matter bends but never breaks you.
•	Effect: You gain damage reduction equal to your CON modifier (after resistances).
•	When reduced to 0 HP, you instead explode in kinetic light, restoring yourself to half HP and pushing all creatures within 30 ft. back 20 ft. (no save). Once per long rest.
•	Narrative: Bullets flatten against you; earthquakes buckle beneath your stance.

4. The Shepherd of Light (Protectors, Healers, Empaths)
Your presence mends what reality cannot.
•	Effect: Allies within 30 ft. automatically regain 5 HP at the start of each of your turns.
•	Once per session, you can resurrect one fallen ally within 10 minutes of death, restoring them to full HP and SP.
•	Narrative: Your aura manifests as wings, halos, or soft illumination that bends around you. The hopeless feel calm when you arrive.

5. The Echo Beyond (Psychics, Telepaths, Illusionists)
You exist in multiple overlapping realities simultaneously.
•	Effect: You are always considered to have three active mirror versions of yourself.
o	Each time you take damage, roll 1d4 (on a 4, an echo is hit instead).
•	Once per session, you may swap positions with any echo (even across worlds or dimensions).
•	Narrative: Cameras capture you in several poses at once. Conversations with you echo before you speak.

6. The Architect of Fate (Control archetypes / O.M.N.I. ascendants)
Causality recognizes your commands.
•	Effect: Once per round, after any d20 roll within 60 ft., you may force a reroll (ally or enemy).
•	Once per session, you may rewrite one event that occurred within the last hour (GM discretion cannot undo player death without consequence).
•	Narrative: Probability bends near you. Strangers feel déjà vu in your presence.

7. The Singularity Heart (Aggression / Greyline archetypes)
You are a walking gravitational event, a collapse given will.
•	Effect: Enemies within 20 ft. take 2d6 force damage at the start of your turn.
•	Once per combat, you can pull all creatures within 60 ft. toward you (STR save or be dragged to within 10 ft.).
•	You are immune to forced movement and cannot be teleported against your will.
•	Narrative: Air bends inward. Gravity whispers your name.

8. The Herald of the Catalyst (Transcendents / Conclave archetypes)
You are the universe’s chosen iteration the metahuman ideal.
•	Effect: You permanently gain +2 to all Ability Scores.
•	Once per session, you can invoke Catalyst Resonance: for one minute, you and your allies deal double damage, regenerate 10 SP each round, and ignore disadvantage.
•	Narrative: When you invoke your resonance, time freezes, the sky fractures, and your emblem glows as if the world itself remembers your story.

9. The Voice in the Static (Shadow archetypes / Morvox thematic)
You no longer speak; reality translates your will.
•	Effect: All enemies within 60 ft. must succeed a WIS save (DC 8 + CHA + prof) at the start of combat or become Silenced and Frightened for 1 round.
•	You may speak through any screen, radio, or network within a mile.
•	Once per session, you can overwrite an NPC’s mind for one hour as if they were your avatar (no roll).
•	Narrative: Technology flickers when you pass. People hear your voice in their comms long before they see you.

10. The Paragon of the Core (Universal / Customization archetype)
You are Catalyst energy made flesh the sum of every Tier achieved.
•	Effect:
o	Gain +1 SP Max, +20 HP, and +1 to all saves.
o	Once per session, you may combine any two powers you know into a single fusion attack (damage + effects stack; cost = total SP + 2).
o	You may choose one additional Transcendent Trait from another category but only at half potency.
•	Narrative: Your aura hums like a reactor. Every power you use now leaves a shimmering imprint of your symbol in the air.

GM Guidelines
•	These are endgame narrative powers. Encourage cinematic use; don’t reduce them to number trading.
•	Every Trait should reshape the world’s perception of the Vigilante: governments react, factions adapt, and even Morvox takes note.
•	Transcendent Traits stack with Augments but cannot be replaced, retrained, or suppressed except through narrative consequence (e.g., Catalyst fracture).
