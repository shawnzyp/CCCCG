# QA Report — Catalyst Core Character Tracker (2025-02-15)

## Automated Testing
- `npm test`
  - Status: ✅ Passed (67 suites, 200 tests). Console output includes numerous warnings/errors from mocked cloud sync and DM tooling modules but all suites succeed.【bae20a†L1-L13】

## Manual Verification
Environment served locally with `npx http-server -p 3000`.

### Findings
1. **Welcome modal close button leaves touch controls disabled**
   - Steps:
     1. Load the app and skip the launch animation.
     2. Dismiss the welcome modal using the top-right “Close” (X) button.
     3. Attempt to interact with header controls (theme toggle, menu, cloud status).
   - Result: Interactions remained blocked because the `touch-controls-disabled` class stays on `<body>`, which removes pointer events from `.app-shell` via the overlay styles.【F:styles/main.css†L4151-L4163】 The close handler registered on `[data-close]` only marked the modal dismissed and never called `dismissWelcomeModal()`, so `unlockTouchControls()` was skipped.
   - Impact: Users who close the welcome modal via the X button cannot interact with the sheet until they refresh or choose another dismissal path.
   - Resolution: Close button, overlay, and Escape key handlers now invoke `dismissWelcomeModal()`, ensuring `unlockTouchControls()` runs whenever the modal is dismissed.【F:scripts/main.js†L22283-L22291】【F:scripts/main.js†L22323-L22328】

2. **Offline asset manifest references missing font path**
   - Steps:
     1. Start the local server.
     2. Observe the console/logs or request `http://127.0.0.1:3000/images/Race%20Sport.woff2`.
   - Result: The request returns 404 because the font files live at the repository root (`Race Sport.woff2`), while the manifest lists them under `./images/`. The offline cache worker therefore reports a failed asset download.【F:asset-manifest.json†L10-L45】【207214†L1-L6】
   - Impact: Offline cache warm-up fails to fully complete, leaving the custom font unavailable when offline.
   - Resolution: The manifest no longer references a non-existent `./images/Race Sport.woff2`, so the offline cache prefetches the real root-hosted font URL.【F:asset-manifest.json†L1-L118】

### Additional Notes
- Repeated `Cloud load failed AbortError` console logs occur locally due to the absence of a configured Firebase backend; these appear to be expected degradations and were not flagged as defects.
